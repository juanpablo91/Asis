We believe in open source AI to democratize technology, provide opportunities and development,
with established standards and rules, creating a transparent and competitive world for the benefit of all.

Asis is a set of standards,rules and framework for the deployment of an ecosystem of AI, based in "Personal AI", Concept analogous to personal computing and how it revolutionized the history of humanity.

## Main Features

## Assistant

A fundamental concept of ASIS is that each person, company, even space or place can be personified in a digital version, from a seed of a foundational model, where each of these is managed independently and personalized.

#### üî® System tools

These are tools by default:

- **Open stream:** Agent specialized for navigating the web, opening and working autonomously in programs.

- **Voice:** Personalize your assistant's voice, convert voices, and more.

- **Multimedia generator:** Agent specific for generating images and video, and modifying them.

- **Asis Chat:** Agent specific for chatting between assistants, exchanging information about patterns, schedules, and more, through a friend request.

> More tools will be added in the future

#### üí° Memory

The memory of assistants will be managed by different algorithms for long-term and short-term storage of basic information.

> Images, videos, and more complicated algorithms will be added in the future.

#### :brain: Super Agent

The super agent is the main agent. It receives all the information from its environment, handles decisions, and communicates with the main model to solve complex problems in an autonomous and self-improving way.

#### üìñ Agents

An intelligent agent is an entity capable of perceiving its environment, processing such perceptions, and responding or acting in said environment in a rational manner to achieve objectives.

> We are interested in applying code from <a href=https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT target="_blank">AutoGPT</a>, which is an open-source project for creating agents.
