# <span> Asis AI </span>

**Documentation**: <a href="https://asis/" target="_blank">https://fastapi.tiangolo.com</a>

**Source Code**: <a href="https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi" target="_blank">https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi</a>

### **Build AI, unique, autonomous, and connected**

Asis is an open-source framework for the deployment of an ecosystem of assistants based on the term "AI personal"
that personalizes, also connected with any software for the middle of libraries and standards, for change information, models, functions, create tools
connected with bases, hardware, and infinite possibilities.

### ‚≠ê The Key features will be:

- **Personalizes:** Create an assistant with voice personalizes, tools default, a memory, a model LLM, and agents, all can be personalizes.
- **Algorithms:** Choose to create different algorithms for managing the memory, generating agents and autonomous behaviors, manipulating data for the assistant, etc.
- Communication between assistants
- Connected your code with assistants through a protocol for change information

### üåê Architecture

#### üî® System tools

Thats are tools per default

- **Open stream:** Agent special for navegate in the web, open an work autonomus in programs

- **Voice:** Personalize your asistant voice,convert voices, and more.

- **Multimedia generator:** Agent specific for generate images and video, and modify those.

- **Asis Chat:** Agent specific for chat between asistants ,change information about patrons,schedule and more,through a friend request.

> [!NOTE]
> More tools will be added in the future

#### üí° Memory

The memory of asistants will be managed by diferent algorithms
for long time and short time, save basic information

> [!NOTE]
> Images,video and algotims more complicated Will be added in the ??/?
> future

#### :brain: Super Agent

The super agent is the main agent, it receives all the information from its environment, it handles decisions and communicates with the main model to solve complex problems in an autonomous and self-improving way.

#### üìñ Agents

An intelligent agent is an entity capable of perceiving its environment, processing such perceptions and responding or acting in said environment in a rational manner, that is, achieving objectives.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We ara interested in apply code for <a href=https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT target="_blank">AutoGPT</a>, this is a open source project for create agents
