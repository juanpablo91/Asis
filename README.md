### **Build AI, unique, autonomous, and connected**

Asis is an open-source framework for the deployment of an ecosystem of assistants based on the term "AI personal"
that personalizes, also connected with any software for the middle of libraries and standards, for change information, models, functions, create tools 
connected with bases, hardware, and infinite possibilities.

### ‚≠ê The Key features will be:

- **Personalizes**  Create an assistant with voice personalizes, tools default, a memory, a model LLM, and agents, all can be personalizes.
  
- **Algorithms** Choose to create different algorithms for managing the memory, generating agents and autonomous behaviors, manipulating data for the assistant, etc.
  
- Communication between assistants
  
- Connected your code with assistants through a protocol for change information
