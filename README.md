We believe in open source AI to democratize technology, provide opportunities and development,
with established standards and rules, creating a transparent and competitive world for the benefit of all.

Asis is a set of standards,rules and framework for the deployment of an ecosystem of AI, based in "Personal AI", Concept analogous to personal computing and how it revolutionized the history of humanity.

### **1. Create a Assistant**

#### What is a Entity AI?

A fundamental concept of ASIS is The AI ​​​​Entity, where each person, company, even space or place can be personified in a digital version, starting from a seed of a foundational model, where each of these is managed independently and personalized.

**Basic Caracteristis:**

- Memory long time
- Nickname
- Description
- Model (Model llm)
- Tools default
- Agents default

**Examples:**

- Michael is a makeup artist and his assistant, called "Mills", is his AI version, managing his clients' schedules, answering questions and calls, connecting with his friends' assistants to go out on weekends, exchanging work with his colleagues.

- John is the CEO of a start-up and "Bert" is the Ai of the company, managing Okrs and always helping employees, with doubts in his field, connecting with every employee assistant, keeping up with everything new, keeping an eye on cybersecurity, paying attention to employee complaints or problems, from the executive layer down.

- wally is an Ai, in charge of a residential building, in charge together with an agent of a security company, of making sure that everything is always safe, checking by cameras, sensors, entrances and more and together with the assistants of its residents, notifying arrivals of visitors as news about remodeling or changes in the rules of the building.

Install:

```shell
$ pip install asisai
```

### More details:

<details>
<summary>Models</summary>

#### Open source Models

- gemma-7b
- Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1
- falcon-7b

#### Commercials Models

- Open Ai GPT MODELS

</details>

<details>
<summary>Tools</summary>

These are tools by default:

- **Multimedia generator:** Agent specific for generating images and video, and modifying them.

- **chat:** chat with your asistant, .
  > More tools will be added in the future

</details>

<details>
<summary>Agents</summary>
An intelligent agent is an entity capable of perceiving its environment, processing such perceptions, and responding or acting in said environment in a rational manner to achieve objectives.

- **open Stream** open any program, navigate in the web, and create works flows.

- **Voice coder:** Personalize your assistant's voice, convert voices, and more.

> We are interested in applying code from <a href=https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT target="_blank">AutoGPT</a>, which is an open-source project for creating agents.

### Architecture

#### Memory

The memory of assistants will be managed by different algorithms for long-term and short-term storage of basic information.

> Images, videos, and more complicated algorithms will be added in the future.

#### Super Agent

The super agent is the main agent. It receives all the information from its environment, handles decisions, and communicates with the main model to solve complex problems in an autonomous and self-improving way.

## Disclaimer

ASIS is an experiment still in very early development, it should not be taken for production, authors, contributors are not responsible for possible intrinsic problems with artificial intelligence, such as hallucinations, offensive language, violent images or other content, such as untruthful information, the models that ASIS uses, can pick up many errors, please use with caution and consciously the code, our mission is that we can get to make the AI code open, transparent and ethical.
