### **Build AI, unique, autonomous, and connected**

Asis is an open-source framework for the deployment of an ecosystem of assistants based on the term "Personal AI" that personalizes and connects with any software through a middle layer of libraries and standards. It can exchange information, models, functions, and create tools connected with databases, hardware, and infinite possibilities.

### ‚≠ê The Key features will be:

- **Personalizes:** Create an assistant with personalized voice, default tools, a memory, an LLM model, and agents. All can be personalized.
- **Algorithms:** Choose to create different algorithms for managing memory, generating agents and autonomous behaviors, manipulating data for the assistant, etc.
- Communication between assistants
- Connect your code with assistants through a protocol for exchanging information

#### üî® System tools

These are tools by default:

- **Open stream:** Agent specialized for navigating the web, opening and working autonomously in programs.

- **Voice:** Personalize your assistant's voice, convert voices, and more.

- **Multimedia generator:** Agent specific for generating images and video, and modifying them.

- **Asis Chat:** Agent specific for chatting between assistants, exchanging information about patterns, schedules, and more, through a friend request.

> More tools will be added in the future

#### üí° Memory

The memory of assistants will be managed by different algorithms for long-term and short-term storage of basic information.

> Images, videos, and more complicated algorithms will be added in the future.

#### :brain: Super Agent

The super agent is the main agent. It receives all the information from its environment, handles decisions, and communicates with the main model to solve complex problems in an autonomous and self-improving way.

#### üìñ Agents

An intelligent agent is an entity capable of perceiving its environment, processing such perceptions, and responding or acting in said environment in a rational manner to achieve objectives.

> We are interested in applying code from <a href=https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT target="_blank">AutoGPT</a>, which is an open-source project for creating agents.
